# Karnaugh Map: Digital Logic
Source: C# and Unity: a graphical Karnaugh map solver, with up to 5-bit inputs.

## Truth table
Input logical expression to view its truth table.

## Karnaugh map
The current truth table state / bits input are used to generate the Karnaugh map.
The Karnaugh map is solved with a custom algorithm (probably less time-efficient than QM) and the loops (essential prime implicants) are drawn to the screen.

Possible todos: circuit diagrams, algebraic simplification.
